# End to End Deep Learning for Large Scale Image Recognition

In this project, I built
* computer vision component of an intelligent billboard system for advertisers
* with an attempt to showcase multiple **Challenges** AI professionals face while performing **Large Scale Image Recognition** tasks
* and the practices they follow solving those challenges in order to develop an **End to End Deep Learning** solution.

Specifically, I 
* performed distributed **Training** of a VGG16 Convolutional network on ImageNet dataset **from scratch**
* used **Transfer Learning** technique to improve VGG16â€™s ability to recognize vehicle model and make
* **deployed** the deep learning model on cloud
* developed a **Web app** generating real-time predictions based on user input
